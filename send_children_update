The goal:

Send an email to my x with information collected from a form and formatted in a "nice manner". The email should be triggered 
by a calendar event.

Form questions: 
  
  Sleep assesment 1-5    
  Food intake assesment 1-5
  Genereal condition assesment 1-5
  
  What each child has been eating for lunch and dinner
  
  If they have showered
  
  Anything else worth mentioning
  
  If the are sick 
    if they are sick you will be transfered tp a "Sick section" with the following questions:
  
    Fever (numeric value)
    
    Medicin intake
    
    Amount of medicin
    
Then the same questions will loop over again with the second child.

The idea is that the form is filled in once a day, or when necessary (medicin intake, fever)
    
When the message is created it will check the calender for what days the children have stayed with me and summarize each day.

  Based on the answers in the assesment question different strings will be included in the email. 
  
    Sleep assesment: 1 = "xx has been sleeping very poorly", or 4 = "xx has slept good" 

  An email draft:
  
    Monday 6/1
    xx has slept poorly. We ate oatmeal for lunch and milk for dinner and xx ate well. She has showered and played 
    with her cousine in the evening.
    
    Thuesday 6/2
    xx has slept very well! We ate frogs for lunch and elk for dinner and xx ate porly. xx got fever (39,2 degrees C)
